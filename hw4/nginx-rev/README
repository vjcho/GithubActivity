This is where we build the nginx docker, with
some pre-installed shells to do swapping. 
NGINX is a reverse proxy, which takes the request
from outside and forwards it as indicated in the
nginx.conf file

FILES:

Dockerfile: 
  starts off with ubuntu, adds a bunch of tools, and then also
  nginx. Then addes the nginx conf, and a bunch of shell scripts. 

  WHy do these files have to be within the docker? 
  where do we put them? why? 
  Do they have the right permisions within ther docker? 
  What port does this docker expose? 
  how do we make sure that something inside the docker is listening on this port? 
  Should this docker contain the ".war" file? Why ? or why not? 

Nginx.conf
  configuration file. Note that it initially redirects to www.cs.ucdavis.edu as a dummy.
  This gets edited to point to web1 by init.sh



init.sh
  changes the nginx conf file in the NGINX containers to point to web1. 
  What happens when the nginx docker receives a web request before the init.sh is run? 
  how do you make shell scripts inside the docker run from outside? (hint: docker exec...) 

swap2.sh
  hot-swaps from web1 to web2. Read this carefully and understand waht is going on, and 


swap1.sh
  hotswaps from web2 to web1. You'll have to write this. Careful with permissions!!!
  Where will this script get executed? 
  How do you make sure this is available inside the running docker?
