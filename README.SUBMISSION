We created swap1.sh which redirects nginx from web2 to web1. This works by changing the 'proxy_pass' in nginx.conf to the new address. This script looks just like swap2.sh, with web1 and web2 switched.

We also wrote the extra credit script 'doswap.sh'. This script runs the commands that we would have otherwise ran manually.

Added scripts:
hw4/doswap.sh
hw4/nginx-rev/swap1.sh


Example commands for switching from web1 to web2:
docker run --network ecs189_default --name web2 activity2
docker exec ecs189_proxy_1 /bin/bash /bin/swap2.sh
docker rm -f web1
